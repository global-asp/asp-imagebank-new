# ASP Imagebank New - Adapted images from the African Storybook

This repository contains images adapted (e.g., colourized) from images in the [African Storybook](https://www.africanstorybook.org) imagebank. Specifically, these images have been either colourized or made into black & white colour-in/outline-style images as part of the [Global Storybooks](https://globalstorybooks.net) project.

The original (unmodified) images can be found in the [asp-imagebank](https://github.com/global-asp/asp-imagebank) repo. All editing, colourization, and artistic modification has been done by **Ingrid Schechter**.

## Structure

The files are arranged in two main folders, `bw` and `col`, depending on the type of modification that has been applied:

* `bw`: **Black & white**, de-colourized outline images suitable for colouring-in
* `col`: **Colourized**, originally black & white images that have been coloured in

Within each of these main folders there are two subfolders `large` and `medium` indicating the size of the images.

The images in the `large` folder are original size, which can be quite large, in lossless PNG format.

The images in the `medium` folder have been resized to the standard Storybooks Canada image size (546x546 pixels), and are all in JPG format.

## License

All of the original images were released by the African Storybook under an open license. These modifications follow those licenses (either CC BY or CC BY-NC). A list of the licenses applying to each set of images is below, arranged by story index number:
